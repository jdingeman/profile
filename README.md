# Vertableüìù
 A modular, version-controlled portfolio system to make vendor/customer data tracking easier.

---

## What is it?
Vertable is a solution to the omnipresent issue of version control in shared documentation. Vendors can set up 'vertables' (version-controlled portfolios) for clients and track changes from both parties.

## Why?
During my time as a project coordinator, I dealth with *so* many documents that were shared between my company and our clients. One of the biggest issues we faced was using Excel based documentation that suffered from lack of adequate version control. We send the document to the client, they make changes and send it back, but *oh wait* this needs to be changed so let's do it for you and send it back for additional changes and then now you have two different versions and we have different versions and everything is chaos. -Justin
